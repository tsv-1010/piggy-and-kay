# piggy-and-kay

Scaffolded Vite + React + SWC + Tailwind project.

Getting started (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Pam\Desktop\piggy-and-kay
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- This project uses `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` for SWC-based JSX transforms.
- Tailwind is configured via `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.
- Edit `src/App.jsx` and `src/index.css` to build your UI.

If you want, I can run `npm install` and start the dev server for you now.
